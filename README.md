This is essentially just a collection of whatever I felt would help me keep track of my journey as a developer. 
I hope to in the near future be able to refer to this repository and see my progress and overall growth. 
I also hope to use this a centralized place for whatever I happen to be working on at any given time. 
Anything you see here is most likely not original in anyway and will be my work unless stated otherwise.
I will be sure to include whatever resources I used and whatever sources I gather knowledge from.
My hopes are that they can help to anyone that happens to stumble upon this themselves.
