# **Getting up and running** 
After deciding on which tutorial to proceed with, I decided that I wanted to work in [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) as my OS primarily because of their dedication to FOSS. I was sure this might pose some unique problems but I figure there's always room for learning more solutions. However, because of my daily necessities, I decided to host Fedora in a virtual machine using [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). In doing this I ran into some issues with getting [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) up and running so I decided to post a short video just in case anybody needs it! You can check it out here:

# **The first step and most difficult step:   _the decision_**

After about a couple of months of youtube tutorials and countless articles, I had finally worked up the courage to begin my first project. A simple  calculator, using tkinter. I found this to be rather simple using Codemy's Tkinter tutorial but of course not without setting up your workspace first:
