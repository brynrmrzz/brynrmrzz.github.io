# **Getting up and running** 
After deciding on my tutorial, I realized that I wanted to work with Fedora as my OS because of their dedication to FOSS. I was sure this might pose some unique problems but I figure there's always room for learning more solutions. However, because of my daily necessities, I decided to host Fedora in a virtual machine using [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) the Installation was rather simple and straightforward.  I uploaded a video to [LBRY](https://lbry.com/), which is a great decentralized alternative for anyone self-publishing any kind of media. You can watch the video at two times speed as it is just a guide to getting Fedora up and running with my preferred IDE visual studio. I also go over getting Fedora up to date and installing visual code with python so we're ready to begin our tutorial with Tkinter.
