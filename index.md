## **Plotly practice** 

Data visualization is some of the most compelling evidence. It has the power to sway minds towards a more honest and transparant understanding of a cause or a solution. I felt learning how to visualize data with python was very achievable and a necesarry skill to help put together some larger scale ideas I have in place.It was rather easy using [Plotly!](https://plotly.com/python/) You can see how I rendered and graphed the data [here.](https://github.com/brynrmrzz/brynrmrzz.github.io/tree/main/python_scripts/graphapp)

## **The ugliest calculator ever** 

First, thank you to Codemy. Their tutorial that was both extremely helpful,intuitive and left little room for confusion. My experience with Tkinter for GUI overall was quick and easy and I got to spend most of my time adding new functions to test my own knowledge of some basic fundamentals. This led me to some interesting bugs for example.

My first attempt at a solution was a step in the right direction but ultimately sent me back to the drawing board.

After some thought, found that with some additional if else logic I could avoid the errors I was seeing. I'm sure there's more I can do to improve it but for  the purpose of which I needed Tkinter, I can move on for now. I'm confident I will come back for a deeper understanding, unless I find a more aesthically pleasing library. You can see the code **[here.](https://github.com/brynrmrzz/brynrmrzz.github.io/python_scripts/simple_calc/simple_calc_w_tkinter.py)** 




## **Getting up and running** 

After deciding on which tutorial to proceed with, I decided that I wanted to work in [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) as my OS primarily because of their dedication to FOSS. I was sure this might pose some unique problems but I figure there's always room for learning more solutions. However, because of my daily necessities, I decided to host Fedora in a virtual machine using [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). In doing this I ran into some issues with getting [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) up and running so I decided to post a short video just in case anybody needs it!

## **The first step and most difficult step:<br/>_the decision_**

After about a couple of months of youtube tutorials and countless articles, I had finally worked up the courage to begin my first project. A simple  calculator, using tkinter. I found this to be rather simple using Codemy's Tkinter tutorial but of course not without setting up your workspace first:
