## **The ugliest calculator ever** 
Thank's to Codemy's tutorial as it was extremely helpful and intuitive and left little room for confusion or misunderstandings. My experience with Tkinter for GUI overall was quick and easy and I got to spend most of my time adding new functions to test my own knowledge of some basic fundamentals. This led me to some interesting bugs like the ones shown here:

<br/>![bug1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brynrmrzz/brynrmrzz.github.io/main/source_imagery/tkinter_calculator/bug-1.gif)
<br/>or perhaps this one which was also equally frustrating:
<br/>![string to floar error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brynrmrzz/brynrmrzz.github.io/main/source_imagery/tkinter_calculator/string-to-float-error.PNG)

They both led me to some interesting attempts that probably only highlight my long journey ahead like this one:
<br/>![attempt-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brynrmrzz/brynrmrzz.github.io/main/source_imagery/tkinter_calculator/attempt-1.PNG)
<br/> Yet, ultimately, this was only a step forward. After some thought, found that with some additional if else logic I could avoid the errors I was seeing. I'm sure there's more I can do to improve it but for  the purpose of which I needed Tkinter, I can move on for now. I'm confident I will come back for a deeper understanding, unless I find a more aesthically pleasing library. You can see the code **[here.](https://github.com/brynrmrzz/brynrmrzz.github.io/blob/36a4854ec4a1c85fe33ba6e6fe2bbc4f0973c39e/python_scripts/simple_calc_w_tkinter.py)**

## **Getting up and running** 
After deciding on which tutorial to proceed with, I decided that I wanted to work in [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) as my OS primarily because of their dedication to FOSS. I was sure this might pose some unique problems but I figure there's always room for learning more solutions. However, because of my daily necessities, I decided to host Fedora in a virtual machine using [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). In doing this I ran into some issues with getting [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) up and running so I decided to post a short video just in case anybody needs it! You can check it out **[HERE](https://open.lbry.com/setting_up_visual_studio_in_a_fedora_virtual_machine_hosted_on_windows#b3702c220e53eb577ebecb3f726a1fb7b75a3eaf)** using [LBRY](https://lbry.com/)

## **The first step and most difficult step:<br/>_the decision_**

After about a couple of months of youtube tutorials and countless articles, I had finally worked up the courage to begin my first project. A simple  calculator, using tkinter. I found this to be rather simple using Codemy's Tkinter tutorial but of course not without setting up your workspace first:
